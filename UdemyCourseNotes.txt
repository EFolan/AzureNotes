User defined routes - IP forwarding

Scenario: Desire forcing net traffic to travel a particular route from azure to your system before having access to the internet.

Azure portal > New > Everything > Route Table

Created route table default has no routes.

Go into routes. Add route.

Route name: name; Address prefix: 0.0.0.0/0 = all traffic

Next Hop type: Virtual network gateway functions as a site to site vpn, forcing all traffic to go via that route.

Route table now contains one route but isn't associated with a subnet.

Go to subnets and search/add the relevant subnet to apply the route table rules.

---

Firewalls are provided in the Azure marketplace.

Being set up is the same as a Route table in that you'd need to force all subnet traffic through the firewall in order for it to be effective.

Availability sets

Multiple VMs can be placed in an availability set (as long as they are similar or serve similar purposes.)

MS will allocate these VMs across their own servers/networks in order to help guarantee a high percentage of availability. 

A new availablity set can be created while standing up new VMs

VMs created: 

Avail-Set-1
User: EFolan
Pass: Chr0ma

Avail-Set-2
Same User and Pass

----------------

Use External and Internal load balancing

Fault domains:
The hardware upon which the VMs run. Different fault domains ensure that not all your VMs share the same hardware.

Update domains:
Updates will never hit all your VMs at once. MS will update one update domain at a time.


Load balancers:

Search load balancers > MS has one > Create.

Public: Traffic that comes in from the internet. Load balancer will distribute this traffic between VMs

Internal: Same but Between internal infrastructure

Probes check if sites are still up

Backend Pools > Create

Machines in Availability set can be added to pool

Back end pool now has all x VMs from the availability set.


Health probes:

Load balancer needs a way to see if VMs are alive. So we use the health probe.

Can be customised to web ports etc.

Will check web page every x seconds and after 2 failed checks determines that this VM has failed.


Load balancing rules: What are we going to do when traffic comes in.

Can specify port mapping shich forces traffic off of port 80 (for example) to port 8000 on the backend machines.

Session persistence: (AKA sticky sessions) None: any user can go to any VM at any time.


-------

Use Application gateway

Relatively new alternative to load balancer.

Only does web based load balancing : http or https

Has a firewall option.

Cookie based session affinity

Secure Sockets Layer SSL installed on the application gateway rather than on the web server giving the server the chance to just do its web server work and not worry about SSL.

Scaling VM sizes

Desire: Scale VM up from A0 to A1 etc.

Virtual machine > Settings > Size > Size choice.

Can take some time to migrate VM.

---------------------------------

Virtual machine scale sets
            
Search VM Scale set

Allows me to allocate several VMs under a single name.

Must be created in a new resource.

REquires a public IP Address
Allows us to assign a domain name upon creation.

Choose OS image same as usual.

Allowed to choose between 1 and 200 instances

Choose machine size...

Autoscale:

When enabled  we can choose a minimum and maximum number of VMs. Can also set a CPU threshold in % for the set to start scaling up the amount of VMs

Also allows Scale down threshold to be set in %

Also: Legal disclaimer saying that VM scale sets can and will deploy multiple azure resources as needed.

This allows all the work of creating multiple VMs to be done rather quickly.

-------------------------------

ARM VM Storage

After creating a VM with a size that allows two disks it is possible to spin up and associate another disk. under Settings > Disks

Plan for storage capacity:

The A series allows local physical HDD of 20GB only.

They allow an additional data disk (Blob storage) to be spun up alongside.

There are limitations on the throughput of that data disk in the A series.

An S as part of the VM series name that means it includes an SSD
EG: DS1, DS2 etc

------

Geo replication options

When creating storage accounts there is a replication option

Lowest level of replication is Locally redundant storage.

3 copies of your files stored locally within the one data centre, spread across multiple locations. 
If one hard disk fails then yours can be rebuilt and restored from copies.

Zone redundant storage stores files within the Geo but in different physical locations.

The Geo could be USA or China etc

Geo redundant storage:
Stores six copies of your files around the world.

REad access Geo redundant storage:
Sets up Read accessible copies around the world.

-----

Premium or standard storage

Differences are a req of the exam

Premium storage is stored on SSDs: No magnetic disks or heads with very low latency.

More expensive than standard storage and only certain types of VM support premium (THe ones with S in the type name)

Premium ONLY supports Locally Redundant Storage

In a HDD environment there is a max of 500 operations per second.

In Premium limits are the expected value rather than peaks.

It's good to really go over these differences for the exam.


---------------------------------


Monitor Azure Virtual machines

It's possible to create alerts for when the % CPU usage breaches a certain threshold.

It can notify us via email or webhook.

Diagnostics:

Allows different types of diagnostics for .net, SQL, ASP etc etc etc.

Can choose one or several different kinds of diagnostics which will be created in a chosen storage account. 

All this can be found in the Monitoring section under VMs.

Good practice to read more up on this as we go along.

--------------------------------

Overview of availability sets

Objective 1.7: MAnaging ARM availability.

Can be managed through availability sets.

Inside Availability set there are a number of VMs.

The AS is configured to have x amount of fault domains and x amount of update domains.

Fault domains:
The separate hardware locations your VMs are running on. An AS with two Fault domains will be able to split it's VMs between two separate pieces of hardware, meaning if one fails the other will still be up and running.

Update domains:
Microsoft will never push updates to all update domains at a time. They will go one after the other meaning that if VMs are spread over Update domains they won't all be incapacitated by updates simultaneously.

Domains are zero indexed in the list in Azure portal.

MS has a service agreement of 99.95% uptime if you have two or more VMs running in an availability set.

Objective 2: Design and implement a storage and data strategy... 25 - 30% of final score.

Create a storage account

Generally you'll use standard (General storage) storage and use Blob storage when you need storage specifically calibrated for blobs.

There's an option for performance: Standard and Premium. We've covered this already. Standard is on HDDs and Premium is on SSDs.

There'll be an option to set the desired replication level. Again, we've covered this before. Typically we'll pick LRS; locally redundant storage. The other options are covered in detail further up.

Let's go over them anyway.

LRS:  Stores three copies of your data in separate physical locations but in the same data centre.

Zone redundant Storage:
Stores three separate copies of your data across different location 'zones' but within the same Geo location. So Data may be spread across the US or China.

Geo redundant Storage:
Six copies of the data are stored across the globe.

Read Accessible Geo redundant storage:
Same as above except you have read access to your file copies.


Encryption is also available.

If we need the data encrypted on the disk it is possible here.

Resource group and location are created as usual.
